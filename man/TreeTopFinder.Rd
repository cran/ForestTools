\title{Treetop Finder}
\usage{
TreeTopFinder(CHM, winFun, minHeight = NULL, maxCells = 2e+06,
  maxWinDiameter = 30, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{CHM}{Canopy height model. Either in \link[raster]{raster} format, or a path directing to a raster file. A character vector of multiple paths directing to a
tiled raster dataset can also be used.}

\item{winFun}{function. Should take the value of a given \code{CHM} pixel as its only argument, and return the radius of the corresponding search window.}

\item{minHeight}{numeric. The minimum height value for a \code{CHM} pixel to be considered as a potential treetop. All \code{CHM} pixels beneath
this value will be masked out.}

\item{maxCells}{numeric. If the number of raster cells for the \code{CHM} exceeds this value, the \link[TileManager]{TileScheme} function
will be applied to break apart the input into tiles to speed up processing.}

\item{maxWinDiameter}{numeric. This parameter prevents \code{TreeTopFinder} from being run with a function that would
produce very large windows, which will affect performance and is likely a sign of an inappropriate window function. Can be disabled
by setting to \code{NULL}.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Print progress to console if set to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\link[sp]{SpatialPointsDataFrame}. The point locations of detected treetops. The object contains two fields in its
data table: \code{height} is the height of the tree, as extracted from the \code{CHM}, and \code{radius} is the radius
of the search window when the treetop was detected. Note that \code{radius} does not necessarily correspond to the radius
of the tree's crown.
}
\description{
Implements the variable window filter algorithm (Popescu & Wynne, 2004) for detecting treetops from a canopy height model.
}
\examples{
# Set function for determining variable window radius
winFunction <- function(x){x * 0.06 + 0.5}

# Set minimum tree height (treetops below this height will not be detected)
minHgt <- 2

# Detect treetops in demo canopy height model
ttops <- TreeTopFinder(CHMdemo, winFunction, minHgt)
