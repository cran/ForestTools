\usage{
glcm(image, segs = NULL, n_grey = 32, angle = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{SpatRaster. A single-band raster layer from which texture is measured}

\item{segs}{SpatRaster. A segmented raster. Cell values should be equal to segment numbers. If \code{segs} are not provided,
GLCM will be calculated for the entire image.}

\item{n_grey}{integer. Number of grey levels into which the image will be discretized}

\item{angle}{integer. Angle at which GLCM will be calculated. Valid inputs are 0, 45, 90, or 135}

\description{
Generate textural metrics using Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Can be applied to an entire or image or, if a coterminous
raster of segments is provided, GLCM can be calculated for each segment.
}
\details{
The underlying C++ code for computing GLCMs and their statistics was originally written by Joel Carlson for the
defunct [radiomics](https://github.com/cran/radiomics) library. It has been reused here with permission from the author.
