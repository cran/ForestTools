#' Forest Tools: A package for analyzing remote sensing forest data
#'
#' Forest Tools provides functions for analyzing remote sensing forest data.
#' Functions like \link{vwf} and \link{mcws} are applied to rasterized
#' canopy height models (CHM) to detect treetops and outline their respective crowns.
#'
#' Once a CHM is segmented into discrete crowns, \link{glcm} can compute textural metrics
#' for each crowns. This is usually done using orthorectified imagery, but can also
#' characterize the CHM's texture.
