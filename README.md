The Forest Tools R package offers functions to analyze remotely sensed
forest data. Currently, tools to detect dominant treetops and outline
tree crowns have been implemented, both of which are applied to a
rasterized **canopy height model (CHM)**, which is generally derived
from LiDAR or photogrammetric point clouds. A function to summarize the
height and count of treetops within user-defined geographical areas is
also available.
